# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

<h3>introduction</h3>
This repository contains a simple React application that uses the RapidAPI service to make translation requests. The application is built using popular JavaScript libraries and tools, including Redux Toolkit, Axios, React, React-Redux, React-Select, and SASS.

With support for a total of 111 different languages, our Translate App makes it easier than ever to communicate with people around the world.

<h3>RapÄ±dApi</h3>
To use the RapidAPI service for translation, you'll need to sign up for an account and obtain an API key. Follow these steps:

Visit RapidAPI and create an account or log in.

Search for a suitable translation API. For this example, you can use the "Google Translate" API.

Subscribe to the API and obtain an API key.

Copy your API key and add it to the .env file in the project, as mentioned in the Installation section.
